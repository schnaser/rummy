## Players
2 players

## Setup

The game is played with all cards in a standard deck, including Jokers. Choose one player to begin play as the Dealer. Players alternate dealing for the duration of the game. 

Deal seven cards to each player. Turn one card from the top of the deck face up beside the deck. This will be the start of the discard pile.

The player opposite the dealer will go first. 

## Draw

The player has the choice of taking one card from the top of the deck, or picking up **any number of cards** from the discard pile. If the player chooses to draw from the discard pile, the bottom-most card must *immediately be used in the same turn* to score points. Any unused cards stay in the player's hand. The player scores, if able to do so, and ends his or her turn by discarding one card.

## Scoring

Once the player has drawn, he or she has the choice of laying down a set or run of at least 3 cards to score points. 2's and Jokers are wild.

### Melds

Set = Same card, different suit, i.e. 7♣ 7♥ 7♦
Run = same suit, different card, i.e. 3♠ 4♠ 5♠

Runs do not "wrap around", meaning the following is not valid: K♠ A♠ 2♠ Aces are high *only*, thus A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is not valid. Any number of valid sets or runs can be laid at one time. There must be at least two non-wild cards in the initial lay.

For example, suppose a player starts off with 3-4-5-6-7-8-9 all in Clubs. The player draws a card, lays his run he started off with, and discards the drawn card. The dealer has not had a turn. The terminology used for the dealer in this case is *"unlucky."*

### Scoring off of existing melds

Scoring can also be done during the course of the game by building off of sets or runs already laid on the table. For example, suppose the table looks like this:

**Player 1**

**3♠ 4♠ 5♠**

**A♣ A♥ A♦**



**Player 2**

**7♣ 7♥ 7♦**

#### Own Melds

Suppose it is Player 2's turn and she draws a 7♠. She can play the card on her existing set to form 7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 7♠ and discard one card from her hand. 

#### Opponent's Melds

Suppose Player 2 draws a 6♠. She can lay the card on her side of the table, scoring 5 points. Then she must discard one card from her hand and it is Player 1's turn. If Player 1 draws a 7♠, he may score that card as well.

#### Wild Cards

Suppose Player 2 draws a 2♠. She cannot play the 2♠ on its own off of Player 1's A♣ A♥ A♦. She must append the wild card to one of her own melds.

#### Rummy

Suppose Player 2 draws a 6♠. Also suppose she has had one too many Bloody Marys and does not notice that her 6♠ matches one of her opponent's melds. She plays her turn as normal, discarding the 6♠. Player 1 can then call **"Rummy!"** and pick the 6♠ from the discard pile and play it on his run. Then he can play his turn as normal. Which is to say, **Rummy** is free points and does not take the place of Player 1's turn. 

Once the player is done scoring, he or she discards one card face up on the discard pile. This is skipped if the player has no remaining cards to discard; i.e. all cards were used to score points.

## Hand End

Once a player has no more cards remaining, the hand is over and the score is counted. Cards laid on the table as part of a player's turn are counted as positive, cards remaining in a player's hand are counted as negative points. 

Scoring is as follows:

### On The Table (+)

| Card | Points |
|--|--|
| 3-9 | 5 |
| 10-K | 10 |
| A | 15 if used in a set |
| A | 10 if used in a run |
| 2, Joker | Value of the card replaced |
| 2, Joker | 25 if used in a set of **only** other wild cards |

### In The Hand (-)

| Card | Points |
|--|--|
| 3-9 | -5 |
| 10-K | -10 |
| A | -15 |
| 2, Joker | -25 |

## Game End

The game is over when a player reaches 500 points. If both players reach 500 simultaneously, the player that finished their turn with no cards remaining (went out) is the winner.
